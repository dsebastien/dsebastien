### Hi there 👋

I’m Sébastien Dubois, a thirty-something Belgian geek.

I’m an IT guy at heart and am very passionate about: software development/design/architecture, the open web, free and open source software.. but I also have other passions such as photography, board games, piano, and errr… well many other things that I don’t have time for ;-)

I was crazy enough to write [a book about the wonderful TypeScript programming language](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-TypeScript-Building-Applications-understanding/dp/1789615860/).

I'm also the owner of a Belgian IT consultancy firm called [DeveloPassion](https://www.developassion.be/).

I love Open Source and have been contributing for many years now. I wish to continue, but without funding, it's hard to keep going. So if you like what I'm doing and want to support me, then take a look at [my Github sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/dsebastien).
