### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Looking for sponsors
I love Open Source and have been contributing for many years now. I wish to continue, but without funding, it's hard to keep going. So if you like what I'm doing and want to support me, then take a look at [my Github sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/dsebastien).

#### About me...

Iâ€™m SÃ©bastien Dubois, a thirty-something Belgian author, CTO, geek, dad, gamer.

I write quite a lot on [my blog](https://dsebastien.net), on [Medium](https://dsebastien.medium.com), and I was also crazy enough to write [a book about the wonderful TypeScript programming language](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-TypeScript-Building-Applications-understanding/dp/1789615860/).

I'm currently writing a series of 12 books called [Dev Concepts](https://dev-concepts.dev), which will cover a gazillion concepts of and around software development. Through this project, my goal is to help as many people as possible to understand the big picture and how to become software crafters / full stack developers: https://dev-concepts.dev/.

The first two volumes are already available:

* https://gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts-Part-01-SoftwareCraft
* https://gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts-Tome-02-WhatClientsNeed

Iâ€™m an IT guy at heart and am very passionate about: software development/design/architecture, the open web, free and open-source software.. but I also have other passions such as photography, board games, piano, and errrâ€¦ well many other things that I donâ€™t have time for ;-)

I'm also the owner of a Belgian IT consultancy firm called [DeveloPassion](https://www.developassion.be/).
