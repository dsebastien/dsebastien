### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Looking for sponsors
I love Open Source and have been contributing for many years now. I wish to continue, but without funding, it's hard to keep going. So if you like what I'm doing and want to support me, then take a look at [my Github sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/dsebastien).

#### About me...

Iâ€™m SÃ©bastien Dubois, a thirty-something Belgian author, CTO, geek, dad, gamer. Iâ€™m an IT guy at heart and am very passionate about: software development/design/architecture, the open web, free and open-source software. But I also have other passions such as photography, board/video games, piano, and errrâ€¦ well many other things that I donâ€™t have time for ;-)

I write quite a lot on [my blog](https://dsebastien.net), on [Medium](https://dsebastien.medium.com), and publish a [weekly newsletter](https://newsletter.dsebastien.net) about IT, Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), personal organization, productivity, and more!

I wrote [a book about the wonderful TypeScript programming language](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-TypeScript-Building-Applications-understanding/dp/1789615860/) and am now working on a series of **12 books** called [Dev Concepts](https://dev-concepts.dev), which will cover a gazillion concepts of and around software development. Through this project, my goal is to help as many people as possible to understand the big picture and how to become software crafters / full stack developers: https://dev-concepts.dev/.

The first two volumes are already available:

* [Volume 1: The Software Craft](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts-Volume-01-SoftwareCraft)
* [Volume 2: What Clients Need](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts-Volume-02-WhatClientsNeed)

The third one is coming soon: [Volume 3: Architecture](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts-Volume-03-Architecture)

I'm the owner of a Belgian IT consultancy firm called [DeveloPassion](https://www.developassion.be/).

#### Software Crafters community

I have created an online community for Software Crafters.
You can learn more about it here: https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-08-25-software-crafters-community

Here's the invite link if you're in a hurry: https://join.slack.com/t/softwarecrafterstalk/shared_invite/zt-umgx3v06-4rtJ20PXz867GTPzCk1zeQ

#### Personal Knowledge Management
I'm spending a ton of time and energy on Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). I've created the [Personal Knowledge Management Library](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/PersonalKnowledgeManagementLibrary), a collection of curated resources about the topic. It's a great starting point for newcomers, but also a super useful reference for PKM enthusiasts and experts.

I am the editor of the [PKM Journal](https://pkmjournal.com/), an online publication dedicated to PKM, note-taking and learning.

I have also created two communities centered on PKM. One on [Slack](https://dsebastien.net/pkm-community) and the other on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalKnowledgeMgmt/). You can learn more about this [in the following article](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-11-12-personal-knowledge-management-community).

Finally note that I also run [a dedicated Twitter account](https://twitter.com/PkmDaily) where I regularly share interesting links about this topic.
