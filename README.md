### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Looking for sponsors
I love Open Source and have been contributing for many years now. I wish to continue, but without funding, it's hard to keep going. So if you like what I'm doing and want to support me, then take a look at [my Github sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/dsebastien).

#### About me...

Iâ€™m SÃ©bastien Dubois, a thirty-something Belgian author, CTO, geek, parent, gamer.

I write quite a lot [on Medium](http://dsebastien.medium.com/) and I was also crazy enough to write [a book about the wonderful TypeScript programming language](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-TypeScript-Building-Applications-understanding/dp/1789615860/).

I've also started writing a new book called "Dev Concepts", which will help many understand the big picture and how to become software crafters / full stack developers: https://dev-concepts.dev/

Iâ€™m an IT guy at heart and am very passionate about: software development/design/architecture, the open web, free and open source software.. but I also have other passions such as photography, board games, piano, and errrâ€¦ well many other things that I donâ€™t have time for ;-)

I'm also the owner of a Belgian IT consultancy firm called [DeveloPassion](https://www.developassion.be/).
